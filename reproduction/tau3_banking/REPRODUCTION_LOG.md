# Reproduction log

## 2026-08-22 — reference reconstruction

- Identified the public leaderboard source as PR 452 and the S3 submission
  `qwen3-8-max_sierra_2026-08-04`.
- Confirmed the result records Git commit
  `fc0055dc4e0a316c3f83133267fbd6faaa770992`, release v1.0.1, domain
  `banking_knowledge`, `alltools`, seed 300, 4 trials, 200 steps, and 10 errors.
- Confirmed the four generated trial seeds directly from all 388 trajectory
  records: 626729, 373753, 361454, and 1567.
- Verified public metadata SHA-256
  `afd5525e447a221f6997b6af8a6a72536acda81b0e7775fd7124836a13a9ad76`
  (1,340 bytes) and trajectory SHA-256
  `8c8191c43dfb2d21c1322cc154740e5e6044151837ab817c2cbbcd13ffeb626e`
  (246,971,719 bytes).
- Recomputed 214 reward points across 388 simulations, exact pass@1
  `55.154639175257735%`, and 388 `user_stop` terminations. No infrastructure
  terminations were present.
- Extracted all 97 four-trial reward vectors into `reference.json`. Selected an
  exact-score gate with tasks `001,003,004,007,014,032,034,035,046,102`:
  22/40 (`55.0%`) with per-trial totals `[6,6,4,6]`. Task 102 replaces the
  cheaper task 010 so the gate covers the benchmark's only NL assertion.
- Recomputed historical provider-serialized costs: $0.14192925 for the one-task
  smoke, $8.84201230 for the 40-conversation gate ($8.33811800 agent plus
  $0.50389430 user), and $246.13332615 for all 388 chats. These figures exclude
  embeddings, NL judges, and Modal.
- Recorded immutable data/source Git objects in `reference.json`. The working
  checkout HEAD matched the official commit.

## 2026-08-22 — harness implementation

- Added an atomic reference fetcher with size and SHA-256 enforcement.
- Added a bounded JSON comparator keyed by task and trial. Score parity and
  tool behavior parity are reported separately; a missing or extra simulation
  cannot pass the score gate.
- Added dry-run-by-default smoke, 10-task subset, and full launch modes. Paid
  execution requires an explicit ceiling acknowledgement. Full execution also
  requires `ALLOW_FULL_RUN=1` and a current exact subset gate receipt.
- Added non-logging OpenRouter credential loading and explicit OpenRouter dense
  embedding transport. Pinned the GPT-5.2 user and GPT-4.1 NL judge to the
  OpenAI provider with fallback disabled. Both OpenRouter API-base environment
  names are manifest-bound and overwritten in the paid child process, so
  ambient endpoint variables cannot redirect requests. Added Modal
  backend/app/timeout environment settings.
- Preserved the official Qwen request arguments and added a free preflight that
  permits paid execution only while the exact dated Alibaba snapshot is Qwen's
  sole active OpenRouter endpoint. Endpoint manifests now retain active and
  matching counts. The committed full shell-order fixture path is set
  explicitly, so an ambient `TAU2_MODAL_ORDER_MANIFEST` cannot redirect a run.
  The wrapper's offline graders and paid children pin `TAU2_DATA_DIR`, disable
  `.env` loading, and resolve `tau2` from this checkout; paid children also
  disable user-site loading and scrub ambient Python/uv project/runtime overrides.
- No paid model, embedding, or Modal evaluation was run while building the
  harness.

## 2026-08-22 — offline harness validation

- JSON validation and `py_compile` under the locked uv runtime passed for the
  config and all eight harness scripts. Ruff lint and format checks passed.
- Submission fetch and second-pass `--verify-only` both produced the pinned
  1,340-byte SHA-256 exactly.
- Recomputed the reference config independently: 97 task files, 388 binary
  rewards, reward sum 214, exact `55.154639175257735%`, gate reward 22/40 with
  `[6,6,4,6]` trial totals, and all four Python-generated trial seeds matched.
- Strict comparison of the official 40-record gate slice against the pinned
  trajectory returned score, grading-component, and tool behavior parity.
  Gate creation now rejects `--score-only` and requires a guarded execution
  manifest, exact provider/judge routes, and strict paired ToolMessage output.
- Added an explicit known-dense-drift gate mode after proving that OpenRouter
  embedding scores cannot be byte-identical to the unrecoverable direct-OpenAI
  cache. Strict behavior diagnostics remain unchanged; the waiver classifies
  only paired assistant `KB_search_dense` ToolMessage content differences and
  requires zero missing, reordered, argument-changed, unpaired, or other tool
  mismatches. This introduced schema-v3 full gates; the later aggregate
  sampling guard supersedes them with schema v4.
- Deliberately changed one reward; the comparator exited 1 and reported the
  exact task/trial reward mismatch. Deliberately removed tool calls; it retained
  score parity but exited 1 with tool count and sequence mismatches.
- Full strict comparison of the public trajectory against itself returned
  388/388 records, reward sum 214, exact pass rate, grading components, and
  tool behavior with zero mismatches. Reproduction configuration/provenance
  validation correctly rejected that historical artifact as a new guarded run.
- Smoke and guarded-full launch plans were generated offline. The full plan had
  97 explicit task IDs, four trials, concurrency 10, and the pinned arguments.
  Full mode correctly refused without `ALLOW_FULL_RUN=1`; paid mode correctly
  refused without `--confirm-paid-api-calls`.
- The configured OpenRouter key shape, local Modal credential presence, Modal
  backend wiring, OpenRouter embedding wiring, and NL-judge environment wiring
  were checked without logging secret contents or making remote calls.
- After the aggregate-sampling, restart-safe resume, raw-cost, and full-manifest
  guards were integrated, the final offline slices passed: 67 focused harness
  and Modal tests, 13 provider-cost tests, and 457 broader banking/environment
  tests with one skip. Both shell-order generators were current, the BM25 oracle
  remained 1,910/1,910, and targeted Ruff, compilation, JSON, and diff checks
  passed. The two legacy `test_llm_utils` generation tests were deliberately not
  run because they make live OpenAI calls; their 13 cost-only siblings passed.

## 2026-08-22 — live parity evidence recorded

- Added a reproducible shell oracle over the exact gate task set. The smoke
  slice matched 6/6 unique commands exactly (report SHA-256
  `55218fe1359c61c0dc818ff3267c7aa4ca10526a2abe2a63849b71770d50e589`).
  The archive-based gate replay matched 215/263 unique commands exactly across
  275 calls (81.7490%; report SHA-256
  `ff92d2b5d24937836ca7c36cbad0d693e1c24ec54433f312b1398085dce7c597`).
  All 48 differences were classified: 47 recursive-grep traversal-order
  differences and one root `ls -la` filesystem-metadata difference.
- Derived one disclosed, uniform filesystem order from public gate trace paths
  and corpus matches. A network-blocked Modal tmpfs validation preserved all
  699 insertion positions and reproduced 59/59 recursive gate commands,
  including all 47 prior ordering mismatches. The deterministic manifest has
  451 constrained filenames, 248 lexical tie-breaks, and SHA-256
  `898b4038585ab4bd10be0ed57f396c4ae5a2b46d8e339e39cc5c8d8219e1d32f`.
  It does not inspect commands or replay output at runtime, but is explicitly a
  trace-derived reproduction fixture and is insufficient for a blind/full run.
- Checked in the deterministic 699-entry order manifest and its offline
  generator. Modal now extracts that order directly onto tmpfs and exposes it
  through the unchanged `/knowledge_base` path. The strict recursive oracle
  reproduced 59/59 commands, and the complete gate shell oracle reproduced all
  263/263 unique commands across 275 recorded calls. The latter also uses a
  narrow normalization for only the total and `.`/`..` rows of a leading bare
  `ls -la`; an explicit-path listing is never normalized.
- Corrected Modal's visible file modes to match the official Linux shell
  (`drwxrwxr-x` directories and `-rw-rw-r--` files) while retaining read-only
  enforcement through root ownership and an irreversible uid/gid 65534 drop.
  A live 698-document `ls -la` check matched file modes, names, and byte sizes;
  a write attempt returned permission denied. Filesystem allocation totals and
  the `.`/`..` metadata remain backend-specific.
- Rebuilt all 698 document embeddings with one OpenRouter route pinned to the
  OpenAI provider. The resulting cache SHA-256 is
  `2600dc04615b3a0bf01ff03dd3868bc6ba78298ca0f9aab158b93ca5f176cdc5`.
- Found that document loading order was host-filesystem dependent. The macOS
  order reproduced only 1,774/1,910 official BM25 calls; lexical loading
  reproduced all 1,910/1,910 exactly. The loader is now deterministic and the
  cache reorders existing embedding rows by document ID without a paid rebuild.
  The effective sorted cache is `(698, 3072)`, finite `float64`, with semantic
  SHA-256 `7b1668a5b9afd48edba1ef195c10b534accafb91f1da8229c91ea0c0fabb562b`.
- Compared all 1,806 official dense calls (1,802 unique queries) against that
  fresh cache: 1,188/1,806 (65.7807%) had the exact top-k order, 1,787/1,806
  (98.9480%) had the same top result, mean top-k overlap was 99.5238%, minimum
  overlap was 75%, and displayed scores were exact for 0/1,806 calls.
- The official embedding cache was not recoverable. Dense retrieval remains an
  unresolved exact-parity blocker, so no paid agent/user simulation was
  launched during this phase.
- Explored a uniform full-corpus shell order without model calls. An ephemeral
  Modal replay matched 4,581/4,614 unique commands (99.2848%) and retained
  263/263 gate-command parity. The command was
  `uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python /tmp/tau3_full_modal_oracle.py`;
  it selected the temporary manifest through `TAU2_MODAL_ORDER_MANIFEST`.
  The candidate file SHA-256 was
  `2dd6900198202d40ad466031be4b86d0fb7d699352680821f66f27e594356de2`,
  its order SHA-256 was
  `f925abd0b262c3317cedffbd1dd5d4c2a5a4495eee77e65834119ebeef7f0bf6`,
  and the report SHA-256 was
  `cc28f4bfe1a50815a91acb140f309677c34b848a738c26e5da58809fdeed8d90`.
  This is explicitly an ad-hoc exploratory measurement: neither temporary
  script nor candidate is checked in, so it is not a standalone receipt and is
  not used by the paid runner.
- Classified its 33 unique mismatches: 10 traversal-order cases, 14 historical
  `sandbox-runtime` exclamation-mark escaping cases (15 calls), four random
  historical `pwd` paths, two EROFS-versus-EACCES diagnostics, one Bash
  argv-zero diagnostic, one missing-SciPy command, and one explicit-path `ls`
  metadata difference. Changed Modal agent commands to invoke
  `/usr/bin/bash`, which fixes the authentic argv-zero difference. Deliberately
  did not rewrite commands, paths, stderr, or tool answers, and did not add
  SciPy or the exploratory order to the scored runtime.

## 2026-08-22 — official-trajectory regrade

- Regraded all 388 published trajectories against the pinned v1.0.1 tasks with
  Modal selected. Regrading created no remote Modal sandboxes; retrieval staging
  stayed local and all temporary environments were released.
- Using the moving `openrouter/openai/gpt-4.1` alias changed task 102 trial 0
  from 0 to 1 and produced 215/388. This isolated the only grading drift to the
  benchmark's sole `NL_ASSERTION` task.
- Switched the judge transport to the exact benchmark model name,
  `openrouter/openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`. A four-trial task 102 probe restored
  final rewards `[0,0,0,0]`, though one non-consequential NL classification
  varied where the DB component was already zero.
- Repeated the complete 388-trajectory regrade with the dated model. It matched
  exactly: reward 214/388, pass rate `55.154639175257735%`, task 102 DB
  components `[1,0,0,0]`, NL components `[0,0,1,1]`, and final components
  `[0,0,0,0]`. This confirms the grading path while retaining the warning that
  a model judge is not guaranteed deterministic even at temperature zero. The
  retained gitignored regrade artifact SHA-256 is
  `6248bed0ad1fb5b8fcd9edeedd447ba3197d5b044ad78e5e51188bedfddd8c8e`.

## 2026-08-22 — live seed-replay diagnosis and aggregate gate

- Published the initial standalone implementation to the user fork branch
  `signalrush/tau2-bench:agent/tau3-banking-modal-parity` as commit
  `f1b1658abb0b1382703d8b686a5febf17b3ef4a3`. A fresh network clone at
  `/tmp/tau3-banking-fresh.18HRmA/repo` passed the locked offline install,
  selected-cache validation, clean-worktree check, and dry smoke without making
  remote calls.
- Launched the first paid smoke with
  `uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py smoke --output-dir reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/gate_trial0 --execute --confirm-paid-api-calls --cost-ceiling-usd 0.25`.
  It produced candidate artifact SHA-256
  `7e594d1f98a9c98cb3d4566549034d6dcbf186904c9526e64696d04de410f764`
  and guarded execution-manifest SHA-256
  `48c41e14193aebb8a9309818ad8eceb1e9935de22a90ecd7f83261c825d8c516`.
- The first paid smoke completed task 001 trial 0 with reward 1, but diverged
  from the published trajectory despite the same seed 626729 and identical
  committed prompts, tools, model arguments, and provider pins.
- Repeated only the first hosted-model requests to isolate sampling. GPT-5.2
  first-user content changed from SHA-256
  `ee51d33b867b92ab172bf8d20e9e8491b767aebf0948b04ad9cd96250a4607be`
  (`gen-1787393465-q38LkKjXJYijmvoTfpYQ`) to
  `1296078c1a996c6291887cf3bfefc046de6612604b657486ead2036a73ef55df`
  (`gen-1787393683-avNYfrT0HhPS0BpykrQ5`), both OpenAI/default. The official
  first-user content SHA-256 is
  `c8bcae567670de2c5c2e4daf0446515c42e0f001f40654622f601c6bc84abf40`.
- Qwen's canonical initial tool call changed from SHA-256
  `80458bfe976f892288e8de50e374fe2e6930cee38419cbff00a4cc0d9d5f4a58`
  (`gen-1787393466-MJM6SNmXOPdQInO9Mvd8`) to
  `489768bcc9eeb8de59fa7582f7a15ac3cb92162f76a26bbb9eff65dac7fd8a0d`
  (`gen-1787393717-LrzM8u8Ls8RMJKyUoNQK`), both Alibaba with null service
  tier. This proves that hosted seed replay is not trajectory deterministic.
- Added an explicit aggregate-only model-sampling gate. Strict per-record
  reward/component, text, call, argument, and output diagnostics are retained.
  When explicitly requested, their sampling-attributable differences may be
  waived only while all 40 task/trial keys, seeds, `user_stop` terminations,
  internally recombinable binary grading, configuration, routes,
  manifest/runtime state, and the exact 22/40 aggregate match. Identical
  non-dense calls with different output remain unwaivable backend drift; the
  separate dense waiver still applies only to identical dense calls.
- Hardened that gate before expanding the paid subset: tool results are aligned
  by exact role/name/arguments across call insertion and reordering, with
  ambiguous duplicate results rejected; reward breakdowns are recomputed from
  canonical DB/action/environment/NL/communication evaluator records; and null
  raw user models are rejected. Each differing deterministic component is now
  recomputed with the authoritative task and official local evaluator in a
  retrieval-free environment, so failed/no-op writes and generic/discoverable
  state mutations receive their exact semantics rather than name-based credit.
  NL outcome drift always requires task 102's validated dated judge route, and
  the full gate requires an exact zero-issue attribution receipt. The paid
  endpoint preflight now requires the same exact GPT-5.2 alias inventory proof
  (4 active total, 3 OpenAI-eligible, all 3 matching the dated snapshot) as the
  comparator.
- Added the ten-task trial-0 intermediate (6/10, historical chat cost
  $2.59890095) before the 40-simulation gate. It can resume the smoke, and the
  full subset can resume it. A partially completed four-trial expansion can
  also resume despite upstream retaining stale `num_trials=1` metadata; exact
  task/trial/seed and bound checkpoint-manifest provenance checks remain.
- The smoke's raw OpenRouter usage costs were $0.154672 agent and $0.0082551
  user, $0.1629271 total. The comparator now reports these non-gating raw
  totals because LiteLLM's mapped top-level agent cost may be zero.
- OpenRouter serialized the user model as `openai/gpt-5.2`. This moving alias
  is accepted only when the bound valid manifest contains the exact catalog
  proof for provider OpenAI and resolved endpoint
  `openai/gpt-5.2-20251211` with four active and three matching endpoints.
  Full-gate verification revalidates the route counters and catalog proof.

## 2026-08-22 — deterministic full-corpus Modal fixture

- Added `generate_full_shell_order.py` and a checked-in 699-entry uniform
  filesystem order derived from the pinned 5,135 recorded shell calls (4,614
  unique commands). The generator treats all 767 subset edges as hard
  constraints, admits only acyclic full-trace edges, and handles compound
  commands conservatively: 54 had a unique segmentation, 31 retained only
  edges safe under every valid segmentation, and one was unsegmentable.
- The resulting fixture has 7,548 precedence edges, constrains 698/699 files,
  and uses the subset order to break the final tie. Its order SHA-256 is
  `ddb11f1a583e408079c136805c786f6e53903afb3dad46047c69a06b3b01b6f3`;
  the manifest file SHA-256 is
  `5f8005d162f81d9eadf6836b296d4a334090daec60c0228770e8b8de890d37f8`.
- Verified the generated fixture offline with
  `uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python reproduction/tau3_banking/generate_full_shell_order.py --check`.
  Then replayed the fixed subset against one live network-blocked Modal sandbox
  with
  `TAU2_MODAL_ORDER_MANIFEST=reproduction/tau3_banking/full_shell_order_manifest.json uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python reproduction/tau3_banking/compare_shell_oracle.py --mode subset --scope all --execute --output reproduction/tau3_banking/artifacts/shell_oracle_subset_full_manifest.json`.
  The result was 263/263 unique commands exact across 275 recorded calls, zero
  mismatches, applied order SHA-256 `ddb11f1a...b01b6f3`, and report SHA-256
  `626fa9d613ec8d789a258bc81d686358b23b2a07131da98b21df841009c7a1bf`.
- Switched the Modal manager default and guarded runner environment to this
  single full fixture for smoke, trial-0, subset, and full runs. Runtime order
  selection remains command-independent and no recorded output is replayed.
- Made abrupt-termination resume provenance crash-safe. A `running` manifest may
  authorize the structurally validated checkpoint produced by that exact
  guarded launch; resumed launches additionally bind the already validated
  pre-run checkpoint SHA-256. Finalized manifests retain exact post-run state
  and checkpoint digest requirements.
  Paid `uv` children inherit the output-directory OS lock, preventing a second
  resume from writing or spending concurrently even if the Python wrapper is
  killed first. Fresh-run absence and resume checkpoint/state provenance are
  rechecked after acquiring the lease and before prewarm or paid launch.
  Successful runs with a transient finalization fingerprint error retain the
  original zero runner exit code and can be recovered only by fresh exact
  checkpoint and clean-state validation.
- Made the full live Modal shell-oracle receipt a hard full-run prerequisite.
  The guard binds its path, SHA-256, official-reference and order-fixture
  digests, complete counts/details, and committed score-impact review. Any
  remaining difference is treated as potentially behavior/score affecting;
  reviewed and explicitly accepted nonzero drift additionally requires
  `--allow-known-full-shell-drift`, which is persisted in the run manifest.
- Added official-schema and half-duplex chronology validation for every
  trajectory. Tool results must follow their pending call with matching ID and
  requestor, participant turns must be valid, call IDs must be unique, and
  repeated stateful call outcomes retain occurrence order. These failures are
  structural/non-waivable. Judge response IDs are also globally disjoint from
  participant generation IDs.

## 2026-08-22 — active full Modal shell receipt

- Ran the final no-model, 4,614-unique-command oracle against the active fixture
  and hydrated Modal image with the exact command:

  ```bash
  env -u TAU2_MODAL_EXPECTED_IMAGE_ID \
  TAU2_MODAL_ORDER_MANIFEST=reproduction/tau3_banking/full_shell_order_manifest.json \
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/compare_shell_oracle.py \
    --mode full --scope all --execute --max-details 100 \
    --output reproduction/tau3_banking/artifacts/shell_oracle_full_active_manifest.json
  ```

  The tracked receipt SHA-256 is
  `17728b8c8ae721e23506a06bd7dfe9a276009222ab17f9af0ada20ace9fd06eb`.
  It binds image-recipe SHA-256
  `fa738d7f079e0b3cfccf0c7e30f140064409afd04732eb3f5182f737f7126795`
  and hydrated Modal image object ID `im-57yaJoNct9YREpBb74YQ0k`.
- The final result is 4,603/4,614 unique commands exact
  (`99.76159514521024%`) and 5,124/5,135 recorded occurrences exact
  (`99.78578383641675%`). All 11 mismatch details are retained, spanning 11
  task/trial records across 10 tasks and zero gate-subset simulations.
- The 11 residuals are three traversal-order differences (tasks 080/0, 023/1,
  and 070/2), four unrecoverable randomized historical working-directory paths
  (067/0, 063/1, 076/2, and 044/3), two EROFS-versus-EACCES diagnostics (019/0
  and 022/3), one explicit-path `ls` ownership/timestamp difference (044/2),
  and one remaining `srt` conditional-shell difference (064/2).
- The compatibility transform mirrors `sandbox-runtime` 0.0.23 by replacing
  each command-argv `!` with `\!`. A targeted 20-command probe matched 17/20
  historical outputs after this transform; the active receipt retains the one
  remaining full-corpus conditional-shell mismatch rather than spoofing it.
- The Modal image pins the exact install call
  `modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("scipy==1.16.3")`. This restores the
  official task 095 trial 2 command whose executable core is:

  ```bash
  python3 - <<'EOF'
  from scipy.optimize import brentq
  bal = 95550.0
  days = 31
  def i(apy): return bal * ((1 + apy) ** (days / 365) - 1)
  ap = brentq(lambda a: i(a) - 450, 0.01, 0.2)
  print("APY that yields $450:", round(ap, 5), f"{ap * 100:.3f}%")
  EOF
  ```

  This is the same numerical operation as the recorded command; formatting-only
  list output omitted here does not alter the executed fixture or receipt.
- Cleanup completed with zero live Modal tasks. The receipt and guard describe
  the residuals honestly: all 11 can change model-visible output, downstream
  behavior, and score. They are explicitly accepted only after an exact 22/40
  live subset and only with `--allow-known-full-shell-drift`; this authorizes a
  distribution-level Modal reproduction, not exact trajectory parity.

## 2026-08-22 — fork publication and fresh-clone receipt

- Published the hardened standalone banking harness to
  `signalrush/tau2-bench`, branch `agent/tau3-banking-modal-parity`, at commit
  `16c5a7661f48a2b4c333105d0a46937c424843d4`. The scoped commit contains
  exactly 19 intended files and no credential-like literals; its parent is the
  initial Modal harness commit `f1b1658abb0b1382703d8b686a5febf17b3ef4a3`.
- Before publication, ran the complete offline regression command over the
  harness, Modal manager/lifecycle, cost, and NL-judge tests: 138 passed and the
  two intentionally live-model tests were deselected. Ruff check, Ruff format
  check, `git diff --cached --check`, receipt/fixture digests, and the full-order
  generator check all passed.
- Cloned that exact fork branch into a new temporary directory and ran:

  ```bash
  uv sync --frozen --extra knowledge
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/fetch_reference.py --artifact all
  uv run --offline --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/fetch_reference.py --artifact all --verify-only
  uv run --offline --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/generate_full_shell_order.py --check
  uv run --offline --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py smoke
  ```

  Dependency sync installed the pinned lock, the public submission and
  236-MiB trajectory both passed their committed SHA-256 checks, the generated
  full order was current, and the dry smoke emitted the exact guarded argv and
  environment without reading a key or making model, embedding, or Modal
  calls. `git status --porcelain` remained empty and the clone HEAD equaled the
  published commit.

## Open parity risks before any full run

1. The official GPT-5.2 user, GPT-4.1 judge, and `text-embedding-3-large` calls
   used direct OpenAI; reproduction must use OpenRouter. Live dense comparison
   is not exact and the official cache is unavailable.
2. Modal replaces the historical local Anthropic `sandbox-runtime`. The active
   disclosed full-trace fixture preserves all 263/263 unique subset shell
   commands (275 recorded calls), including the strict 59/59 recursive slice.
   It is trace-derived and constrains 698/699 files. The earlier ad-hoc
   full-corpus probe reached 4,581/4,614 unique commands with a different order.
   The pinned active-fixture receipt reaches 4,603/4,614; its 11 model-visible
   differences remain potentially behavior/score affecting and require the
   explicit full-run acknowledgement described above.
3. GPT aliases may have moved since 2026-08-03. Qwen paid execution is blocked
   unless its sole active endpoint remains the exact Alibaba snapshot; still
   confirm raw response provider/model fields in smoke output before the subset.
4. The official result does not serialize concurrency. Ten was reconstructed
   from launch overlap; it is not a signed metadata field.

## 2026-08-22 — fail-closed credit and checkpoint validation

- A final paid smoke attempt reached OpenRouter but received HTTP 402 for
  insufficient credit. Upstream `tau2 run` nevertheless exited zero after
  serializing one `infrastructure_error` simulation, and the wrapper initially
  treated that process exit as completion. The exact command was:

  ```bash
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py smoke \
    --output-dir reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/parity_b5480c1 \
    --execute --confirm-paid-api-calls --cost-ceiling-usd 0.25
  ```

  The resulting checkpoint SHA-256 is
  `88ab27ca094323160596533c43129f6a9e6f2afbb2da9f10508ef5c9e48c4410`;
  it contains exactly one infrastructure-error record, no generated model
  response, and no model usage cost. No benchmark result was claimed.
- Paid execution now performs an authenticated `GET /api/v1/credits` with the
  authoritative file credential before it creates the output directory or
  starts cache, model, or Modal children. Both returned totals must be finite
  and nonnegative, and their difference must cover the selected mode's full
  historical chat cost. Unavailable, malformed, or insufficient state fails
  closed. The ignored run manifest stores only the numeric allowlist and check
  time, never the key, raw response, headers, or response labels; no current
  balance is committed here.
- A zero upstream exit is now accepted only after exact task-by-trial coverage,
  zero infrastructure errors, and the pre-existing structural, grading,
  provider, response-ID, cost, and judge-route validators all pass. Failure is
  finalized as `post_run_validation_failed` with wrapper exit 2. A guarded
  resume may retain infrastructure-error records only because upstream removes
  those records and retries exactly their task/trial keys; already validated
  `user_stop` simulations remain preserved.
- Published these guards at
  `f3c10b6c49cd464f73938bb07a7d08eb3d60d847`, then ran this live no-model
  preflight against a deliberately new output path:

  ```bash
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py smoke \
    --output-dir reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/credit_guard_probe_f3c10b6 \
    --execute --confirm-paid-api-calls --cost-ceiling-usd 0.25
  ```

  It returned wrapper exit 2 for insufficient OpenRouter credit, created no
  output directory, and launched no benchmark child. The current balance is
  intentionally not committed. A fresh clone of the published commit also
  emitted the exact guarded dry plan from a clean worktree.

## 2026-08-22 — paid smoke and 10-task trial-0 gate

- After the guarded credit check became sufficient, verified that branch
  `agent/tau3-banking-modal-parity` was clean and that the fork contained exact
  HEAD `48a92ecf69bebd2d6eae37a54c98c929e39ff85b`. Started a new run directory
  bound to that commit with:

  ```bash
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py smoke \
    --output-dir reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/parity_48a92ec \
    --execute --confirm-paid-api-calls --cost-ceiling-usd 0.25
  ```

  Smoke completed `task_001` trial 0 with `user_stop`, reward 1, exact DB and
  action grading, zero infrastructure errors, and valid Qwen/Alibaba and
  GPT-5.2/OpenAI route receipts. Raw chat cost was `$0.32992025` (agent
  `$0.318456`, user `$0.01146425`), `2.32454x` the historical `$0.14192925`.
  Strict behavior was not identical: 22 tool calls versus the official 9 and
  37 tool-call/output mismatches, all causally classified as model-sampling
  drift; combined scoped waivers left zero residuals. The immutable smoke
  comparison SHA-256 is
  `6fb7fc6d8f356413f18f2b0ed3c8b716c5fdbe6872eb1110e18282b0d774ebd9`.

- Resumed the same checkpoint into the documented ten-task trial-0 gate:

  ```bash
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py subset_trial0 \
    --output-dir reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/parity_48a92ec \
    --resume --execute --confirm-paid-api-calls --cost-ceiling-usd 3.5
  ```

  It completed all 10 simulations with `user_stop`, no infrastructure errors,
  and exact aggregate `6/10 = 60%`. Raw agent/user chat cost was `$3.25845055`
  (agent `$3.11104`, user `$0.14741055`); the task-102 dated GPT-4.1 judge cost
  was `$0.111872`. Task-level rewards swapped on task 014 (`0 -> 1`) and task
  034 (`1 -> 0`). Task 102 retained final reward 0 but recombined from official
  `DB=1, NL=0` to live `DB=0, NL=1`; both trajectories and every differing
  deterministic component reproduced exactly under the offline evaluator, and
  the NL change used the dated OpenAI judge route.

  The initial comparison found two conservative residuals after otherwise
  validating aggregate score, configuration, runtime/manifest, structure,
  grading, participant routes, response IDs, and judge provenance. Both were
  the unexecuted task-034 transfer-request outputs `#7` and `#8`: the candidate
  stopped after the exact ordered stateful prefix `#1` through `#6`, while the
  comparator treated the missing reference suffix as ambiguous. The comparator
  now classifies only an expected-side missing suffix after an exact observed
  prefix as downstream model-sampling drift. Candidate-added, middle-missing,
  reordered, content-changed, requestor-changed, and error-changed duplicate
  outputs remain fatal. Two regression tests cover the accepted suffix and
  rejected middle gap; the full focused harness file passes 90 tests.

  After that fix, all 363 tool-call/output mismatches are attributed to the
  disclosed sampling scope, zero behavior mismatches remain outside the waiver,
  grading integrity and score attribution are valid, and the exact trial-0
  aggregate remains 6/10. Checkpoint SHA-256 is
  `5849608ebd33dacf0f3eb969bdc842717f0adb3ec23724e48738c8b7d6ae20d2`;
  completed execution-manifest SHA-256 is
  `5353c9b7eefc1fe7f61e4b98aba2166c82c9e226607710f4b4b8a18097a4c7ea`;
  detailed post-fix comparison SHA-256 is
  `a8455566b0dd37f9341a313ab6c553bfe78e3b9f765e508aee67cc2f4c14862e`.

## 2026-08-22 — 40-run subset mismatch and full-run refusal

- Preserved the exact trial-0 checkpoint and its original clean commit by
  temporarily shelving only the audited comparator/log/test patch, then ran:

  ```bash
  uv run --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/run.py subset \
    --output-dir reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/parity_48a92ec \
    --resume --execute --confirm-paid-api-calls --cost-ceiling-usd 12
  ```

  The credit preflight was sufficient, the runner retained the existing ten
  keys, and all remaining 30 predeclared task/trial keys completed. The full
  checkpoint contains exactly 40 `user_stop` trajectories, zero infrastructure
  errors, 701 unique participant response IDs (471 Qwen assistant and 230
  GPT-5.2 user responses), valid dated task-102 judge provenance for every
  trial, and a passing post-run structural/grading/provider validation receipt.
  The checkpoint SHA-256 is
  `85a62d20e497a163bb7a2bc63ee5441eed1ef21931872619ce579ee09154f204`;
  execution-manifest SHA-256 is
  `7933b8553fa7d63c9dbe36efef2241044571dc3063bd04082b735eba047f8170`.

- The live aggregate was **26/40 = 65%**, not the required **22/40 = 55%**.
  Live rewards by trial were `[6, 7, 7, 6]` versus official `[6, 6, 4, 6]`.
  Ten binary outcomes flipped:

  ```text
  task_001 trial 2: 0 -> 1
  task_003 trial 2: 1 -> 0
  task_007 trial 2: 0 -> 1
  task_014 trial 0: 0 -> 1
  task_014 trial 1: 0 -> 1
  task_014 trial 3: 1 -> 0
  task_032 trial 2: 0 -> 1
  task_034 trial 0: 1 -> 0
  task_034 trial 2: 0 -> 1
  task_034 trial 3: 0 -> 1
  ```

  Net task-level differences were `+1` for tasks 001, 007, 014, 032, and 034;
  `-1` for task 003; and zero for tasks 004, 035, 046, and 102. Every changed
  deterministic DB/ACTION component reproduced from its own trajectory under
  the pinned offline evaluator; grading-integrity and causal-attribution issue
  counts were both zero. This rules out scalar-grader or stale-component drift.

- Raw agent/user chat cost was `$11.92734985` (agent `$11.461118`, user
  `$0.46623185`), `1.349x` the historical `$8.8420123`; four dated GPT-4.1
  judge calls added `$0.442644`. Dense embeddings were served from the pinned
  cache and Modal cost is not serialized. The 40 conversation durations sum to
  8,224.31 seconds; concurrent wall time was about 19.6 minutes.

- The detailed offline comparator reported exact configuration, runtime and
  execution-manifest state, schema/protocol structure, raw Alibaba/OpenAI
  participant routes, unique response-ID binding, dated judge routes, and
  grading integrity. Strict trajectories nevertheless had 319 generated-text
  divergences and 1,347 tool-behavior mismatches: 237 argument, 37 count, 40
  sequence, 469 missing-output, 562 unexpected-output, one known dense-output,
  and one other same-call output difference. Of these, 1,343 are attributable
  to model-selected sampling changes and one is the separately disclosed dense
  drift. Three deliberately unwaived stateful-output diagnostics remain:
  candidate-added task-034 trial-2 transfer output, candidate-added task-102
  trial-3 referral read, and a task-102 trial-2 referral read after divergent
  referral writes. They do not explain the scalar mismatch; they keep the trace
  gate conservative. Detailed comparison SHA-256 is
  `894394be905fd49fcc3b7209861f5863778702354a11ec2bf7aebece987d06bc`.

- Transport and sampling evidence explains why identical seeds do not recreate
  trajectories. Every first GPT-5.2 request recorded exactly 81 fewer prompt
  tokens through OpenRouter than the official direct-OpenAI request; only 10/40
  first user messages were byte-identical. On those same ten trajectories, the
  first Qwen prompt-token count was exactly equal to the official trace, but
  all ten first Qwen tool calls still differed despite the same Alibaba route,
  model snapshot, seed, policy, task, tools, and xhigh-only arguments. Across
  all 40 records, zero first Qwen generations were fully identical. The excess
  score is therefore consistent with remote seeded sampling/transport drift,
  not a harness configuration, route, Modal, or grader mismatch.

- Finally attempted the documented gate write with both narrowly disclosed
  waivers:

  ```bash
  uv run --offline --frozen --extra knowledge python \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/compare_results.py \
    reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/parity_48a92ec/results.json \
    --mode subset --max-mismatch-details 2000 \
    --output reproduction/tau3_banking/runs/parity_48a92ec/subset_gate_attempt.json \
    --write-gate reproduction/tau3_banking/.state/subset_score_parity.json \
    --allow-known-dense-drift --allow-model-sampling-drift \
    --reference-results \
      reproduction/tau3_banking/artifacts/banking_knowledge_results.json
  ```

  It failed closed with exit 2 because aggregate sampling mode still requires
  the exact official reward sum. No gate file was written, and no full run was
  launched. Replaying, replacing, or cherry-picking failed keys would invalidate
  the fixed subset experiment and is intentionally not used. The 40-run
  checkpoint, three execution manifests, smoke/trial-0 comparisons, and detailed
  subset comparison are force-tracked as immutable receipts even though the
  general `runs/` directory remains ignored.

## 2026-08-22 — Nemotron 3 Super exploratory smoke

- Verified the live paid OpenRouter route for the real
  `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`. The selected endpoint was BF16
  DeepInfra with a 262,144-token context, 16,384-token completion ceiling,
  seed/tool support, and fallback disabled. The agent request used medium
  reasoning (the highest explicitly supported effort), `temperature=1.0`,
  `top_p=0.95`, and `max_tokens=16000`. The GPT-5.2 user simulator retained
  low reasoning, OpenAI-only routing, and fallback disabled.

- The guarded credit check reported `$929.9503964839969` available before the
  call. A one-task diagnostic was launched from clean published commit
  `e9a1d560f97a4a6381c24f9ae23cff9357a929e8`, with task `task_001`, seed
  `626729`, concurrency one, alltools retrieval, and the pinned Modal image and
  full shell-order fixture. This diagnostic predated the standalone runner and
  is evidence only; the scored full run will use a new same-commit canonical
  runner smoke.

- Outcome: reward `1/1`, correct Gold Rewards Card application, DB/action
  checks exact, `user_stop`, duration `242.79228062502807` seconds. All 26
  generated agent responses were `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` through
  DeepInfra; all three generated user responses were `openai/gpt-5.2` through
  OpenAI with default service tier. All 29 response IDs were unique. Serialized
  chat cost was `$0.079370495` (`$0.069426295` agent and `$0.0099442` user).

- Result SHA-256:
  `28e319cf7cd5e475d54a1e2dddc8787303746666453c132890745802d48ba44d`.
  Diagnostic manifest SHA-256:
  `ad9bb8272588ce213c13e2ca0ebee722a074ec61c5438a9362468ac16a611c91`.

## 2026-08-22 — Linux takeover, 81-token root cause, and direct-OpenAI transport

- Took over the reproduction on the Linux/WSL2 host from a fresh clone of the
  published fork branch. Verified the `~/.rllm/config.json:api_keys.openrouter`
  credential (same account the prior session used; sufficient credit), the
  active `rllm-project` Modal profile, and the fetched reference artifacts.
- Root-caused the constant 81-token first-request delta recorded for every
  gate task. All 40 official first GPT-5.2 user requests bill exactly 81 more
  prompt tokens than byte-identical requests through OpenRouter. Evidence:
  - OpenRouter's `cost_details.upstream_inference_prompt_cost` divided by the
    catalog prompt price reproduces the reported prompt token count exactly
    (972.0 for task_001), so the delta is real billed content, not accounting.
  - The official artifact's simulation guidelines, task JSON, greeting, and
    persona are byte-identical to the pinned v1.0.1 data, and a tiktoken
    reconstruction of the system prompt and greeting accounts for the request
    to the token per toolset; the residual overhead depends only on the task's
    user toolset and differs by exactly 81 for every distinct toolset. This
    isolates the delta to the fixed, schema-independent Chat Completions tool
    harness that direct OpenAI includes and OpenRouter's upstream forwarding
    omits.
  - A local mock-server capture proved litellm 1.81.11 sends byte-equivalent
    request bodies for `gpt-5.2` (direct) and `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.2`, so
    the difference is created server-side at OpenRouter.
  - Paid micro-probes (~$0.01): replaying the exact task_001 first request via
    OpenRouter with `parallel_tool_calls` passthrough returned the same 972
    tokens, and `provider.require_parameters` rejected the parameter outright
    ("No endpoints found that can handle the requested parameters"), proving
    no OpenRouter parameter can restore the official framing.
  - The official user simulator emitted parallel tool calls 16 times across
    388 simulations, behavior the OpenRouter framing does not expose. Under
    the official per-task reward vectors, the observed live subset excess
    (26/40 vs 22/40) sits at the 94.5th percentile (P(sum >= 26) = 5.54%), so
    a cooperative-user bias from the missing harness is a plausible mechanism
    and the transport difference is not ignorable.
- Switched the pinned reproduction transport for the GPT-5.2 user simulator,
  dated GPT-4.1 NL judge, and dense embeddings to direct OpenAI (the official
  transport), keeping the Qwen agent on OpenRouter exactly as the official
  run did. The user model is pinned to the official-resolved dated snapshot
  `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11`. reference.json records the superseded OpenRouter
  transport block verbatim with the reason. run.py now loads a second
  authoritative credential from `~/.rllm/config.json:api_keys.openai` with the
  same ambient-match policy, pins `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1`
  in the manifest and paid child, and adds a free dated-snapshot catalog
  preflight for both pinned OpenAI models. The GPT-5.2 moving-alias catalog
  proof machinery was removed with the transport that required it; the
  comparator now requires the direct raw shape (dated response model, no
  OpenRouter provider field, `chatcmpl-` response-ID prefix, service tier
  `default`) for user and judge responses, keeps OpenRouter `usage.cost`
  binding for the agent, and binds the serialized litellm message cost for
  direct-OpenAI responses, which is exactly the shape the official artifact
  records.
- The direct-OpenAI document-embedding cache is intentionally unpinned:
  `state_fingerprint.py` fails closed with the observed semantic SHA-256 until
  the one-time direct cache build is reviewed and pinned. The prior
  OpenRouter cache pin is retained as a provenance comment.
- Regenerated the full 4,614-command Modal shell-oracle receipt in the
  `rllm-project` workspace: 4,603/4,614 unique commands exact across 5,135
  recorded calls with the same 11 reviewed residuals, byte-identical to the
  prior workspace's details, from the same image recipe SHA-256
  `fa738d7f079e0b3cfccf0c7e30f140064409afd04732eb3f5182f737f7126795` hydrated
  as the new image object `im-tnDKIdJXoHwMlRrrDMB8FX`. reference.json rebinds
  the image object ID and the new receipt SHA-256
  `c2fb4c7612348d40391aeb7ebb8b783046c2183c166efbb755954f2661678c1a`; the
  cheap strict slice also reproduced 59/59 recursive gate commands here.
- The focused offline harness suite passes 90 tests after the transport
  rewrite; the banking-domain offline regression selection passes end to end,
  and Ruff check/format are clean. The offline dry smoke emits the direct
  argv: `--user-llm gpt-5.2-2025-12-11 --user-llm-args
  '{"reasoning_effort":"low"}'` with `TAU2_NL_ASSERTIONS_MODEL=
  gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`.
- Next steps require a billing-active `api_keys.openai` credential: build and
  pin the direct embedding cache, record a fresh dense comparison against the
  official trajectory, then restart the paid progression (smoke, trial-0,
  subset gate at exactly 22/40, acknowledged full run) in a new run directory
  bound to the new clean commit.

## 2026-08-22 — OpenRouter transport reinstated by owner decision

- The owner directed that all GPT-5.2/GPT-4.1/embedding access continue to use
  the OpenRouter credential; no direct-OpenAI key will be provided. The
  direct-OpenAI transport switch from the previous entry is therefore
  reverted: run.py, compare_results.py, state_fingerprint.py, the harness
  tests, and the transport block of reference.json are restored to their
  validated states from commit f1bfcd1 (the exact code that produced the live
  smoke, trial-0, and 40-run subset receipts). The 81-token root-cause
  analysis remains fully documented above and stands as accepted, explicitly
  disclosed non-parity: the OpenRouter user transport provably lacks the
  official request's constant 81-token Chat Completions tool-harness framing
  and the parallel tool-call capability the official user simulator exercised
  16 times in 388 simulations.
- Retained from the intervening work: the Modal image rebind to this
  workspace's content-identical rebuild `im-tnDKIdJXoHwMlRrrDMB8FX` (same
  recipe SHA-256, all 11 full-oracle residuals byte-identical) and the
  regenerated full shell-oracle receipt with SHA-256
  `c2fb4c7612348d40391aeb7ebb8b783046c2183c166efbb755954f2661678c1a`.
- Consequence recorded for the aggregate-score gate: under the official
  per-task reward vectors, the one completed live subset's 26/40 sits at the
  94.5th percentile. If the accepted transport difference biases the user
  simulator upward, the exact 22/40 gate may be systematically hard to reach;
  each fresh subset attempt is an independent ~$12.40 sample of that
  distribution. This is a knowing acceptance, not an unexplained residual.

## 2026-08-22 — exact 22/40 subset, endogenous-drift replay proof, gate provenance

- Restarted the staged progression at clean commit
  `aa6eaa5cffadb6f7f470b2235caa543d998e6e01` in a fresh run directory
  `runs/parity_aa6eaa5`. Paid smoke reproduced task_001 trial 0 with reward 1,
  `user_stop`, exact routes, and raw chat cost `$0.1843701`. The ten-task
  trial-0 intermediate completed 10/10 `user_stop` with aggregate 7/10 versus
  the official 6/10 (task_014, official vector 0011, passed trial 0); all 338
  behavior diffs were sampling-attributed with zero dense residuals.
- Resumed into the 40-run subset. All 40 simulations completed `user_stop`
  with zero infrastructure errors and aggregate **exactly 22/40**, matching
  the official 55.0%. Trial sums were `[7,4,6,5]` versus official `[6,6,4,6]`
  (aggregate-waiver scope). Raw agent/user chat cost for the full directory
  was `$11.85` with 676 unique participant response IDs; configuration,
  structural, raw-route, judge-route, execution-manifest, grading-integrity,
  and zero-issue sampling-attribution checks all passed.
- The gate write initially refused: 2 of 1,364 behavior mismatches fell
  outside both waiver scopes, both task_102 `get_referrals_by_user` stateful
  reads — one same-call output difference after divergent sampled
  `submit_referral` writes, one candidate-added duplicate read with no
  matching official outcome. These are the same conservative classes the
  previous session documented. The comparator now proves endogenous state
  divergence exactly: a residual stateful-output mismatch is attributed to
  the model-sampling scope only when the official `no_knowledge` environment
  replay of the owning trajectory's own call history reproduces the observed
  output byte-exactly (both sides for same-call pairs, the owning side for
  ambiguous duplicates; reads evaluated on a deep copy at their exact
  position). Retrieval and shell outputs are never re-derivable this way and
  stay fatal, as do failed replays. Committed as
  `2422f71` with four focused regression tests.
- The gate write then refused because the candidate's commit trailed the
  fixed comparator's HEAD. Added explicit dual-commit gate provenance:
  a gate may be written from a newer HEAD only when the candidate commit is
  its ancestor and every changed path since is inside the evaluation-only
  allowlist (harness run/compare code, tests, docs) — the checkpoint's
  production runtime (`src/tau2`, `data/`, reference config, fixtures, state
  fingerprinting) must be exactly the candidate commit. The gate binds both
  commits and the changed-path list; full-gate verification recomputes the
  same proof from the bound checkpoint and requires the manifest's post-run
  runtime head to equal the candidate commit with an unchanged embedding
  cache. Anything else fails closed.
- Separately, the guarded Nemotron 3 Super evaluation launched at the same
  commit: its smoke initially failed on a transient DeepInfra
  `engine_overloaded` shared-pool 429 (recorded as an infrastructure error
  and retried under the same manifest), then completed with reward 1/1 and
  the pinned BF16 DeepInfra/OpenAI routes; the bound 97-by-2 full run is in
  progress.

## 2026-08-22 — owner-directed single-trial full scope

- After the type-scope and manifest-provenance fixes, the subset gate was
  rewritten and the four-trial full run launched cleanly at `6c4aa41` into
  `runs/full_6c4aa41`. The owner then directed a cost reduction to a
  single-trial full evaluation, and the run was interrupted by SIGINT after
  18 completed simulations (~$6.71 raw chat cost); its manifest finalized as
  `failed` and the directory is retained as a receipt.
- `modes.full` now covers all 97 tasks for trial 0 only (derived seed
  626729): expected coverage 97, expected reward sum exactly **54/97**
  (`55.6701%`, the official trial-0 slice), credit requirement one quarter of
  the recorded four-trial chat cost. The published `214/388` remains the
  four-trial figure and is no longer this mode's live target.
- Gate provenance handles the config change narrowly: a committed
  `reference.json` delta is evaluation-only when the parsed configs differ
  ONLY inside `modes.full` (compared from the committed blobs), and a bound
  manifest's recorded config digest is accepted when it hashes the exact
  committed blob at that manifest's own runtime head under the same
  full-mode-only proof. Every other config delta still fails closed.
- The concurrent Nemotron 97-by-2 full pass ended with mass retryable
  DeepInfra `engine_overloaded` infrastructure errors; spaced resume passes
  will retry only those records.
